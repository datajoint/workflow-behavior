# DataJoint Workflow - DeepLabCut

The DataJoint Workflow for DeepLabCut combines multiple DataJoint Elements for
markerless pose estimation with [DeepLabCut](https://www.deeplabcut.org/). DataJoint
Elements collectively standardize and automate data collection and analysis for
neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a modular pipeline for data storage and
processing with corresponding database tables that can be combined with other Elements
to assemble a fully functional pipeline.

Installation and usage instructions can be found at the 
[Element documentation](https://datajoint.com/docs/elements/element-deeplabcut).
